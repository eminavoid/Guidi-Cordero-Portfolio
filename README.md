Pong 2 and Rising steam are both works in progress, these were made as univeristy poryects. Pong 2 is on hold for now as it uses SDL libraries and im needing some experience to keep working on it. 
Rising Steam is a group proyect, currently is no more than a play test, the main mehcanics are already implemented but the game progression is not yet developed.
Loompas is in the last stages of development, currently working on english translations before release, later the third and fourth chapters will be developed and published as well
